			Chicken
		</div>
		<p>The modern chicken is a descendant of red junglefowl hybrids along with the grey junglefowl first raised thousands of years ago in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent.[2]
Chicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC.[3] Chicken was one of the most common meats available in the Middle Ages.[citation needed] It was eaten over most of the Eastern hemisphere and a number of different kinds of chicken such as capons, pullets and hens were eaten. It was one of the basic ingredients in the so-called white dish, a stew usually consisting of chicken and fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar.[citation needed]

			Beef
		</div>
		<p>This is a very basic beef stew. It’s easy, delicious and inexpensive to make. While there are hundreds of variations of this traditional recipe, it’s hard to improve on this version’s savory and comforting goodness.
For even better flavor, make this dish the day before you plan to serve it.

			Sushi
		</div>
		<p>The name sushi originates from rice marinated with vinegar and salt. A long time ago this rice was used to preserve food, so that it stayed fresh in the humid and hot climate of Japan. The initial form of sushi was oshi-zushi, that is to say vegetables and fish put into a wooden box together with brined rice. Sushi has been served in this form until today. With time a wider variety of additional ingredients started to be used, like fish, vegetables and mushrooms. An inseparable addition to sushi is wasabi, green horseradish that grows in mountain stream valleys in Japan.
This ingredient is under strict protection, and so the horseradish used for the preparation of sushi is cultivated on special farms.
